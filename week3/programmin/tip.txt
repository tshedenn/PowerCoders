Tip Calculator.

Possible Questions:

1. How should it work?
==> total bill should include tip.
2. How much percentage should be added as tip? ==> 5%
3. Will it be all the time same percentage or will it change as per the customer's preference? 
 (the user allowed to input the tip percentage as per the customer's will?)
 ==> It should be set to 5% all the time.
4. Do you want to print total bill and tip seperatly or the total of both together?
==>yes first the total bill (excluding all others), then total tip and the tip plus total bill equal the gross.
5. Do you want to convert to as whole number or keep it as decimal?
==> yes convert to the nearest one. Eg:if it is 13.1 then convert to 13.
6. Do you want to print percentage?(like how much percentage as a tip).
==> yes percentage(5%) as tip.

Pseudocode:

aTipCal:

       ...START...

INITIALIZE totalBill as 0;
PROMPT user totalBill;
Convert totalBill to a number;
INITIALIZE tipPercentage as 5/100;
INITIALIZE totalTip;
INITIALIZE totalPayableBill as 0;


Process :totalTip = totalBill * tipPercentage; 
         totalPayableBill = totalBill + totalTip;
Convert totalPayableBill to whole number.
Display: "Your total bill (without including tip) is " + totalBill;
       : "Your total tip (5%) is " + totalTip;
       : "Your total is " + totalPayableBill;

       ...END...
