Constraints.

1. Only one torch.
2. Tunnel is narrow so only 2 persons can go through. 
3. The torch lasts only 12 minutes.
4. Afraid of the dark.
5. Moving at the speed of the slower one.


Solution:

1. First Dad and Mama go, takes 2 minutes.
2. Dad comes back,takes 1 min.
3. Son and the daughter go, takes 5min.
4. Mama comes back, takes 2min.
5. Dad and mama go, takes 2min, in total time taken is 12min.

Conclusion: Slowest couple goes together and the fastest two goes together, and the fastest one always takes the return route to return the torch.



1. Compare time of all 4 people
2. see who is the slowest and fastest.
3. make them couple as fastest and slowest
4. first send the fastest couple to the other side.
5. from the fastest couple send back the fastest one to the other side to hand over the torch.
6. now send the slowest couple.
7. now from three of them send back the fastest one with torch,
8. now we have the fastest couple in the starting point and the slowest on the other side.
9. now send the fastest couple .
10. now see if everyone is at the other side.
11. if so you are successful.

Steps:

 1. INITIALIZE totalTorchTime as 12min  
 2. INITIALIZE totalMovingPeople as 2 persons
 3. INITIALIZE totalPeopleTomove 4 people
 4. INITIALIZE fatherTime as 1min
 5. INITIALIZE mamaTime as 2min
 6. INITIALIZE sonTime as 4min
 7. INITIALIZE daughterTime as 5min
 8. INITIALIZE trackTime as 0min
 9. INITIALIZE toCheck as 0
 10.INITIALIZE maxTime
 11.INITIALIZE minTime 
 12.INITIALIZE fastestCouple
 13.INITIALIZE slowestCouple
 14.INITIALIZE sortedTime
 

 sortedTime = sortTimeOrder(fatherTime,mamaTime,sonTime,daughterTime) 
 


..START..

1. send the 2 fastest 
   totalPeopleTomove - 2
   trackTime = totalTorchTime - (slowest person time)
   send back 1 fastest
   totalPeopleTomove + 1 
   trackTime = totalTorchTime - (return person time)
   check if totalPeopleTomove > = 0;
  send 2 slowest 
  totalPeopleTomove = 1
  trackTime = totalTorchTime - (slowest person time)
  send back the fastest
  totalPeopleTomove + 1
  trackTime = totalTorchTime - (return person time)
  if totalPeopleTomove > = 0
  send fastest 
  trackTime = totalTorchTime - (slowest person time)
  totalPeopleTomove = 0
  if totalPeopleTomove >= 0 && totalTorchTime == 0
  print "your solution failed"
  else
  print(yes you solved.)
